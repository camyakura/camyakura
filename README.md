# Hi, I'm CameronðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring web developer, and I've been learning Javascript as well as HTML and CSS. Before I started coding I was working as an electrician and a cashier at Burlington. I decided it was time for a career change because trade work is taxing on my body and not something I could see myself doing long term. I've always had a gravitation towards computers whether it be video games, building computers, or fixing my parent's and grandparents' computers when they stopped working. Coding has taught me how to go about fixing my mistakes in code as well as in real life. This is my journey to learn and grow with coding.
